had to use the www.com file from the floppy exercise

need to install radare2

couldn't get radare2 to produce anything meaningful.

Found another app to decompile - I think I was close but couldn't figure out how to decompile or debug.

eventually used dosbox and outputted the www.com to a .txt file.  Found the flag.
