this one had nc moar.ctfcompetition.com 1337

ran the command

provides the --man output for socat which is more powerful than nc

tried to connect using console without much success.

used xterm - to try and send commands

note for CTFs - normally the flag when jumping boxes is in root or home.  Otherwise you have to look around.

sent a !cat on the home/moar directory and found the CTF within the .sh file.
